# Night Bot Song Request To Txt

## INTRO 


## WHAT IT DOES

<<<<<<< HEAD
Thats when I made this program. It uses the Libary Google OAUTH to autateate the login of nightbots api.

then it reads the song name and tranfers it to a txt file ready to read by open broadcast software or other broadcast programs
It will automaticly update the txt file every  10 sec to update the song on the broadcaster
